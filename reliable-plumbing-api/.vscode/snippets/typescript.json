        // Place your snippets for TypeScript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
        // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
        // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
        // same ids are connected.
        // Example:
        "Promise": {
            "prefix": "promise",
            "body": [
                "${1:return} new Promise<${2:any}>((resolve, reject) => {",
                "",
                "",
                "});"

        },
        "then": {
            "prefix": "then",
            "body": [
                "then((${1:result}:${2:any}) => {",
